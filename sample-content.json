Here are three common strategies:</p><div class=\"mt-8 space-y-6\"><div class=\"p-6 rounded-xl border bg-card\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Cost-Plus Pricing (The Simple Method)</h3><p class=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Calculate your total cost to produce one item, then add a percentage markup for profit. For example, if a t-shirt costs ₹100 to make, you might add a 50% markup and sell it for ₹150. It's simple, but ignores what customers are willing to pay.</p></div><div class=\"p-6 rounded-xl border bg-card\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Competitive Pricing (The Market Method)</h3><p class=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Research what your competitors are charging and set your price around the same level. This keeps you competitive, but can lead to a 'race to the bottom' on price where no one makes a good profit.</p></div><div class=\"p-6 rounded-xl border bg-card\"><h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Value-Based Pricing (The Pro Method)</h3><p class=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Set your price based on the value you provide to the customer. If your product saves a customer ₹10,000 in time and frustration, charging ₹1,000 for it can seem like a great deal, even if it only cost you ₹50 to make. This is harder but can lead to much higher profits.</p></div></div>",
