Today, we'll explore how your thoughts and feelings about money—your 'money mindset'—shape your financial future. We'll learn to spot sneaky spending habits and build a strong foundation for success.</p><h3>Core Concepts:</h3><ul><li><strong>Instant vs. Delayed Gratification:</strong> Learn why waiting for a bigger reward is a financial superpower. We'll look at the famous 'marshmallow test' and see how it applies to buying that new video game versus saving for a car.</li><li><strong>Emotional Spending:</strong> Feeling bored, stressed, or pressured by friends? These feelings can lead to 'retail therapy.' We'll identify your personal spending triggers and create a plan to manage them.</li><li><strong>Uncovering Your Money Scripts:</strong> You have hidden beliefs about money from your childhood. We'll uncover these 'money scripts' (like 'money is the root of all evil' or 'you have to work hard for money') and reframe them for a healthier financial life.</li></ul><h3>Why This Matters:</h3><p>Small, consistent habits create massive results over time. Saving a little bit from your first part-time job can grow into a significant amount by the time you graduate, thanks to the power of compounding!</p>",
